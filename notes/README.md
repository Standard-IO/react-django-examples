This example use react as frontend and django as backend, node and python; respectively. This a normal example of a CRUD application with a sqlite database (so the list is ellminated once the container is eliminated).

Frontend and backend sections have its own devcontainer file to be used to develop. This devcontainer has all the tools necessary to develop in both languages.

This can be easily deployed with docker just runing the next command in this directory: 

```bash
docker compose up
```
